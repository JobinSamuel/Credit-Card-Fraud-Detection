# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Credit card fraud detection is a peculiar classification problem due to very high imbalance in instances of normal and fraudulent transactions as examples. 
Collecting historical data to train the model. Cleaning the historical using various data cleansing technique and imputing missing data and normalizing data if required and feature extraction. 
Splitting the data into three parts where 60% of the data will be considered as training data 20% will be considered as validation data and the remaining 20% data will be considered as test data.
Several popular algorithms in supervised, ensemble and unsupervised categories were evaluated on different metrics. 
Used various supervised Learning algorithms like Na√Øve Bayes and Logistic Regression.
Since their accuracy was about 75%. In other words, the model would detect credit card fraud only 75% of the times which would not be enough.
So, unsupervised learning techniques were used to get better accuracy rate than supervised learning techniques.
