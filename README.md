# Loan Default Prediction Using Machine Learning
This project aims to predict loan defaults using machine learning techniques. By analyzing financial data, the goal is to identify patterns that can help in forecasting whether a customer will default on a loan. Several machine learning algorithms have been applied, and the performance of each model has been evaluated based on precision, recall, and other relevant metrics. The project demonstrates how machine learning can be used to solve real-world problems in the financial sector.

#  Project Overview
The model was built using various machine learning algorithms, including:

Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Naive Bayes
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Perceptron
These models were trained and tested on a dataset that includes various financial features such as bill amounts, payment history, and demographic information about customers. The goal is to predict whether a customer will default on a loan or not.

# Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: The dataset was cleaned and transformed to ensure accuracy. Missing values were handled, categorical features were encoded, and numerical features were scaled to improve model performance.
Feature Engineering: New features were derived from existing data to better capture important patterns related to customer behavior and financial history.
Model Evaluation: Models were evaluated using precision, recall, and F1 score, with confusion matrices helping to assess the models' true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative rates.
Optimization: The Logistic Regression model was further optimized using mini-batch gradient descent to improve training efficiency and accuracy.

# Insights
Feature Importance: Certain features, like bill amounts and payment history, had a significant impact on predicting defaults. Understanding these features can help financial institutions prioritize risk factors.

Class Imbalance Handling: The dataset was imbalanced, with more non-default customers than default ones. This imbalance was addressed by adjusting evaluation metrics and model thresholds to ensure better classification of the minority class.

Precision-Recall Trade-off: In financial applications, balancing precision (minimizing false positives) and recall (minimizing false negatives) is crucial. This project demonstrates how adjusting thresholds can impact the modelâ€™s performance based on the business requirement.

Model Comparison: Different models were compared to understand their strengths and weaknesses in terms of prediction accuracy. Logistic Regression and Decision Trees performed well, but tuning hyperparameters and using ensemble methods could further improve performance.

# Requirements

# Conclusion
This project showcases the application of machine learning in predicting loan defaults, which has practical implications in risk management and financial decision-making. By carefully selecting features, evaluating models, and optimizing parameters, we can create a reliable system to predict customer defaults and reduce financial risks.
